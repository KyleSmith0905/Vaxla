The CLI to Vaxla is designed to use as few keystrokes as possible. What originally could be called with `cd ./apps/web && npm run dev` would instead be called with `vx run web dev`.

## Using the CLI

::tabs
	::div{label="Install Locally" icon="lucide:badge-check"}
	_Recommended,_ Introduce Vaxla to your project by installing it at the root of the project.
	:pm-install{name="--save-dev @vaxla/cli"}
	::

	::div{label="Install Globally" icon="lucide:lightbulb"}
	You may install the package globally if you need to use the CLI outside of your project.
	:pm-install{name="--global --save-dev @vaxla/cli"}
	::

	::div{label="Use Without Installing" icon="lucide:flask-conical"}
	_Not recommended,_ the CLI can be used without installing by executing it directly from the package manager, great for experimenting different versions.
	:pm-x{command="@vaxla/cli <command>"}
	::
::

You may receive a list of commands by running `vaxla` or `vaxla help`.

Instead of using `vaxla`, we also provide the following aliases: `@vaxla/cli`, `vaxla`, and `vx`. There are no functional differences between aliases.

## Running Individual Commands

We understand that you may not want to run the Vaxla UI just to run a single command. We provide a `vaxla run <package> <script>` command to run individual commands.
