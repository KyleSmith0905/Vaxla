We aim to provide more ways to create pages, right now we only support articles.

## Articles

Articles are time-organized markdown files for documenting new features and changes.

Articles can be created inside of the `/vaxla/articles` directory.

Articles are simple markdown files with a section for metadata at the top, like: `title`, `description`, `author`.

```md

title: An Example Title
description: A simple description of the article
author: Kyle Smith

The markdown files are rendered using Nuxt Content.
Nuxt Content supports rich text formatting.
